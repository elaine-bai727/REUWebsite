## Finding the Redshift Completeness Fraction of the Local Universe

Advisors: Adam Miller and Steve Schulze
### Abstract
The discovery of exotic transients (i.e. Gravitational Waves) have provided major insights into the local universe. Yet finding the optical counterparts to said objects remains a major hurdle, as localizations tend to be imprecise ($\r$50 deg$^2$ at best). One way to more easily said counter parts is to find the Redshift Completeness Fraction (RCF) – the fraction of galaxies whose redshifts are known - of said localization. We provide an updated RCF calculation with sample of ~9000 Supernovae (SNe) from Bright Transient Survey (BTS), and host galaxy redshifts from NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).  We then compare the RCF to previous studies and find that the current RCF is higher than that of previous studies. We also find SNe type also affects the overall RCF calculation. <br>

## Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Magnetic Activity in Sub-Subgiants

### Abstract 
Since their discovery, sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) have been a puzzling phenomenon because they appear to be redder and under-luminous compared to normal subgiant and giant stars on a color magnitude diagram (CMD). One hypothesis is that SSGs are rapidly rotating stars in tight binary orbits. Rapid rotation generates strong magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields may inhibit convection, causing stars to be cooler and larger than predicted by standard stellar models. We present a sample of stellar spectra taken with the Robert G. Tull Coudé spectrograph on the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory for a sample of 74 SSGs. We analyze the H-alpha line region of the spectra. The SSGs are categorized into three distinct categories: H-alpha emission lines only, H-alpha absorption lines only, and variable H-alpha. We find that H-alpha variability is the most common H-alpha profile type amongst SSGs, followed by absorption lines only, and standard emission as the least common H-alpha profile. We also analyze the Calcium II H and K line region, finding widespread Ca II H & K emission but with less variability than observed in H-alpha. We conclude that SSGs show some signs of chromospheric activity, which is indicative of strong magnetic activity, but that an additional component may be needed to explain the complex line profile shapes of the H-alpha features.
