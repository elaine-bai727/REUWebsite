## Finding the Redshift Completeness Fraction of the Local Universe

### Abstract
The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) conducted by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) from May 2018 through the end of 2024 was designed to spectroscopically classify every transient in the ZTF public alert stream that peaked brighter than m = 18.5 mag. During that time more than 10,000 transients were classified, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified transients from a single time-domain survey.  One aim of the BTS was to measure the Redshift Completeness Fraction (RCF) - the fraction of galaxies in the nearby Universe with known redshifts. Here we present an updated measurement of the RCF using BTS supernovae as tracers of nearby galaxies. Host galaxy redshifts are compiled from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The RCF has significantly increased  compared to previous studies, especially for low luminosity and/or high redshift galaxies (20% of galaxies known at z=0.15 vs. 10% in previous studies). These improvements can be largely attributed to the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), which aims to collect ~10M redshifts for galaxies with r < 19.5 mag. We also find the RCF as traced by core collapse supernovae is higher than the RCF as traced by Type Ia supernovae, suggesting there is a bias in current galaxy redshift catalogs toward star-forming vs. passive galaxies. This bias should be accounted for when searching for transients in large three-dimensional localization regions, such as the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, because binary neutron star mergers can occur in both star-forming and passive galaxies.  <br>

## Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Magnetic Activity in Sub-Subgiants

### Abstract 
Since their discovery, sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) have been a puzzling phenomenon because they appear to be redder and under-luminous compared to normal subgiant and giant stars on a color magnitude diagram (CMD). One hypothesis is that SSGs are rapidly rotating stars in tight binary orbits. Rapid rotation generates strong magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields may inhibit convection, causing stars to be cooler and larger than predicted by standard stellar models. We present a sample of stellar spectra taken with the Robert G. Tull Coudé spectrograph on the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory for a sample of 74 SSGs. We analyze the H-alpha line region of the spectra. The SSGs are categorized into three distinct categories: H-alpha emission lines only, H-alpha absorption lines only, and variable H-alpha. We find that H-alpha variability is the most common H-alpha profile type amongst SSGs, followed by absorption lines only, and standard emission as the least common H-alpha profile. We also analyze the Calcium II H and K line region, finding widespread Ca II H & K emission but with less variability than observed in H-alpha. We conclude that SSGs show some signs of chromospheric activity, which is indicative of strong magnetic activity, but that an additional component may be needed to explain the complex line profile shapes of the H-alpha features.
